             Who doesn't love a succulent meatloaf? Whether it's being served lukewarm at a middle school in the bible belt or being scarfed down at a Michelin star restaurant by a billionaire who's wife looks like she could be his daughter, meatloaf is enjoyed the world around! I hope this loaf of meat brings you all the joy in the world and then some, because you deserve it. Don't you?

             <li>3 garlic cloves minced (about 1 tablespoon)</li>
             <li>2 pounds 90/10 ground beef (900g)</li>
             <li>2 large eggs</li>
             <li>⅓ cup milk (80mL)</li>
             <li>¾ cup panko breadcrumbs (55g)</li>¾ cup panko breadcrumbs (55g)
             <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li> 
             <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
             <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
             <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
          
           </ul>


       <!-- 4. Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading
               followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.-->

               <h3>Prep work</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a 
                medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Make the meat sauce</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>

                <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>

                <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Preheat oven and cook the lasagna noodles</h3>

             <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>

                <li>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool.</li>

                <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Assemble</h3>

             <ol>
                <li>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed.</li>

                <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.</li>

                <li>Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.</li>

                <li>Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.</li>

                <li>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</li>

                <li>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>

            </ol>

            <h3>Bake</h3>

            <ol>

                <li>Bake for 35 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 10 more minutes.</li>

                <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving to allow the layers to set.</li>

            </ol>
