             Who doesn't love a succulent meatloaf? Whether it's being served lukewarm at a middle school in the bible belt or being scarfed down at a Michelin star restaurant by a billionaire who's wife looks like she could be his daughter, meatloaf is enjoyed the world around! I hope this loaf of meat brings you all the joy in the world and then some, because you deserve it. Don't you?

             <li>¾ cup panko breadcrumbs (55g)</li>
             <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li> 
             <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
             <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>

           </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>Meatloaf:</h3>

        <ol>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a small sheet pan with foil or parchment paper. Grease the tray with olive oil or nonstick spray.</li>

            <li>Heat a small skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil, then the onions and ½ teaspoon of salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 6 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for one more minute. Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl and let cool until just warm, about 15 minutes.</li>

            <li>Once the onion mixture has cooled, add the ground beef, eggs, milk, Panko, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, Italian seasoning, remaining 1 teaspoon of salt, and pepper. Mix gently but thoroughly to combine.</li>

            <li>Gather the mixture together and place it on the prepared baking sheet. Form into a rectangular shape that is 8x4x2-inches. Bake for 30 minutes.</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Glaze:</h3>
           
            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl, stir together the ketchup, brown sugar, and Worcestershire sauce until combined.</li>

                <li>Brush half of the sauce evenly over the meatloaf. Return to the oven and bake until a thermometer inserted in the center registers 160°F, 20 to 25 minutes. Brush the remaining sauce over top. Let rest 10 minutes before slicing.</li>

            </ol>
