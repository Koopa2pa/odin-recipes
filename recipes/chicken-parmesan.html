        <p>
             People say the experience of eating chicken parmesan is akin to having a kindly Italian man cradle you in his arms and rock you to sleep. These people are freaks and should not be trusted. Nonetheless, chicken parmesan is a delicious dish that even a beginner can make, and I hope you enjoy this recipe.
